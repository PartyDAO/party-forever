# CLAUDE.md

Refer to the project doc **CLAUDE.md** at the repo root for:

- Repo structure (apps/frontend, packages/contracts, packages/scripts)
- Conventions (file naming, imports, viem, Radix UI, forms, etc.)
- Contract class pattern and frontend conventions
- Rules in `.cursor/rules/` (component-organization, arrow-function-components, flexbox-layout, yarn)

When in doubt about how to do something in this codebase, check CLAUDE.md first.
